# denTest

A small program that can read a Gaussian matrix file containing molecular orbitals and overlap matrix, and outputs the wavefunction symmetry (symmetric, colinear, coplanar, noncoplanar).

To compile the program, edit the makefile included as required and type make.

For further information on running the program type ./denTest.exe --help

Details on the methodology can be found in Henderson, T. M., Jiménez-Hoyos, C. A. & Scuseria, G. Magnetic Structure of Density Matrices. Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 14, 649–659 (2018).
